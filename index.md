## About me ##
I'm a Postdoctoral researcher with NOAA-Fisheries at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole, MA. Currently, I am working on identifying thresholds in pressure-response relationships between ecological indicators, fishing, and the environment. In my research, I often find myself considering these types of questions: 

+ What effects do humans have on marine ecosystems?  
+ How can we use ecological indicators to inform management action?  
+ How can we monitor ecosystem status in the midst of a changing climate?

###  Lab Notebook ###
To encourage collaborations, maintain open-research, and to facilitate teaching, I have created a repository in the form of an open <a href="/notebook/notebook/">lab notebook</a>. Posts within my notebook are not meant to be polished scientific writings, but notes about my research that will help keep track of my projects. My notebook holds my own personal thoughts and doesn't represent the views of any other person, NOAA, or any other institutions.

<i class="icon-phone"></i> Please don't hesitate to <a href="/notebook/notebook/contact/">contact me</a> if you have any questions about any of my research!
