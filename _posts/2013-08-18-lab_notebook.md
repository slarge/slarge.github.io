### My Lab Notebook ###
Welcome to my notebook! Like a traditional pen and paper scientific notebook, my online notebook is a place for me to store and share my thoughts, efforts, and quandaries. In this light, the writing might not be fully polished and I might only report enough to remind myself of the purpose and most pertinent bits. Unlike a traditional notebook, however, an online notebook provides me a few neat opportunities.

#### Collaborations ####
I am engaged in several projects with international collaborators. The GIT framework (more about this forthcoming) this notebook is constructed with is a great way to to work through the scientific method and to manage versions of code and data.

#### Open Research ####
Open-research is an important concept to me. Although much of the data that I work with is not public, this notebook will be an outlet to present well documented and reproducible analyses using generated or public data.

#### Teaching ####
I am neither a computer scientist nor a programmer, and in the last several years I have worked hard to develop my programing skills. Much of my research involves empirical statistics, so the <a href="http://cran.us.r-project.org/">R programming language</a> was an obvious choice for me to learn on. In learning R, I find that carefully documented examples can be incredibly informative, and this notebook will be a great venue to expand catalogue.
